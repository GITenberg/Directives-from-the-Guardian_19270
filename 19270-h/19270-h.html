in the Aqdas are, whenever practical and not in direct conflict with
the Civil laws of the land, absolutely binding on every believer or
Bahá’í institution whether in the East or in the
West. Certain laws, such as fasting, obligatory prayers, the consent
of the parents before marriage, avoidance of alcoholic drinks,
monogamy, should be regarded by all believers as universally and
vitally applicable at the present time. Others have been formulated
in anticipation of a state of society destined to emerge from the
chaotic conditions that prevail today.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“When the Aqdas is published, this matter will be
further explained and elucidated. What has not been formulated in the
Aqdas, in addition to matters of detail and of secondary importance
arising out of the application of the laws already formulated by
Bahá’u’lláh, will have to be enacted by the
Universal House of Justice. This body can supplement but never
invalidate or modify in the least degree what has already been

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The importance of the institution of Bahá’í
Archives is not due only to the many teaching facilities it procures,
but is especially to be found in the vast amount of historical data
and information it offers both to the present-day administrators of
the Cause, and to the Bahá’í historians of the
future. The institution of Bahá’í Archives is
indeed a most valuable storehouse of information regarding all the
aspects of the Faith, administrative as well as doctrinal. Future
generations of believers will be surely in a better position than we
are to truly and adequately appreciate the many advantages and
facilities which the institution of the Archives offers to individual
believers and also to the community at large. Now that the Cause is
rapidly passing through so many different phases of its evolution, is
the time for the friends to exert their utmost in order to preserve
as much as they can of the sacred relics and various other precious
objects that are associated with the lives of the Founders of the
Faith, and particularly the Tablets They have revealed. Every
believer should realize that he has a definite responsibility to
shoulder in this matter, and to help, to whatever extent he can, in
rendering successful and valuable work which National and local
Bahá’í Archives committees are so devotedly
accomplishing for the Faith in America.”</p>

ecclesiastical organizations on the other, will inevitably incite
Christian ecclesiastical leaders to vehemently oppose and undermine
the Faith, the believers will then have a real chance to defend and
vindicate the Cause. Under present conditions it would be inadvisable
for the American community to give such issues too much prominence.”

DISPENSATION (Duration of)</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Concerning your question relative to the duration
of the Bahá’í Dispensation. There is no
contradiction between Bahá’u’lláh’s
statement in the Íqán about the renewal of the City of
God once every thousand years, and that of the Guardian in the
Dispensation to the effect that the Bahá’í cycle
will extend over a period of at least 500,000 years. The apparent
contradiction is due to the confusion of the terms cycle and
dispensation. For while the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh
will last for at least one thousand years, His Cycle will extend
still farther, to at least 500,000 years.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The Bahá’í cycle is, indeed,
incomparable in its greatness. It includes not only the Prophets that
will appear after Bahá’u’lláh, but all
those who have preceded Him ever since Adam. These should, indeed, be
viewed as constituting but preliminary stages leading gradually to
the appearance of this supreme Manifestation of God.”</p>

regarding the question of admittance of applicants into the Cause.
This is certainly a matter which calls for the utmost tact, wisdom
and consideration on the part of Bahá’í
Assemblies. While, as he himself has repeatedly stressed, a uniform
procedure should be adopted and followed whereby every applicant
should be required to express his whole-hearted and unconditional
acceptance of the essential verities of the Cause, great care should
also be taken not to insist on matters of a secondary importance
which the newcomer cannot, for obvious reasons, fully grasp and
apprehend at the beginning. Once the applicant has been admitted in
the Community with a clear understanding of the duties and
responsibilities, and essential implications which such membership
entails, there would be no difficulty for him in gradually adjusting
his whole ideas according to the requirements set forth in the
Teachings. The process of becoming a Bahá’í is
necessarily slow and gradual. The essential is not that the beginner
should have a full and detailed knowledge of the Cause, a thing which
is obviously impossible in the vast majority of cases, but that he
should, by an act of his own will, be willing to uphold and follow
the truth and guidance set forth in the Teachings, and thus open his

opinion that the N.S.A. should first make some suitable extracts from
the Testament and to send these to all the local Assemblies for their
use, so that there may be full unity in circulating the provisions of
the Will among the new believers. The problem of choosing such
excerpts is left entirely to the discretion of the N.S.A. The main
thing, as it appears to the Guardian, is that the full station of the
Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
be clearly explained and that the origin, nature and working of the
Administrative Order of the Faith be clearly stated. The full
implications of such a recognition are evidently beyond the
comprehension of any new believer. Such a knowledge can be acquired
gradually and only when the essentials of the Faith have been clearly
recognized and adequately understood.”</p>

strength of the Cause grows no matter how much disrupted its

decide, in order to be buried next to your dear husband, to return to
the Church, you either would have to, in good faith, deny Bahá’u’lláh

yourself whether he would wish you to leave the truth for this day

Tactfulness, extreme caution and wisdom are equally important. We
should not be in a hurry when we announce the message to the public
and we should be careful to present the teachings in their entirety
and not to alter them for the sake of others. Allegiance to the Faith
cannot be partial and half-hearted. Either we should accept the Cause
without any qualification whatsoever or cease calling ourselves
Bahá’ís. The new believers should be made to
realize that it is not sufficient for them to accept some aspects of
the teachings and reject those which cannot suit their mentality in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“As regards the meaning of the Bahá’í
Covenant: The Guardian considers the existence of two forms of
Covenant both of which are explicitly mentioned in the literature of
the Cause. First is the Covenant that every Prophet makes with
humanity or, more definitely, with His people that they will accept
and follow the coming Manifestation who will be the reappearance of
His reality. The second form of Covenant is such as the one
Bahá’u’lláh made with His people that they
should accept the Master. This is merely to establish and strengthen
the succession of the series of Lights that appear after every
Manifestation. Under the same category falls the Covenant the Master
made with the Bahá’ís that they should accept His
administration after Him.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The Guardian, like the Master before him, has not
considered it advisable to as yet permit any person or Assembly to
put another person out of the Cause of God. There is a sharp
distinction between depriving a believer of his voting rights, which
is a severe disciplinary measure and not a spiritual sanction, and
pronouncing a former believer to be a truly spiritually diseased
soul, a soul in the condition the Master referred to when, in His
last cable to America before His ascension, He said: ‘He who
sitteth with a leper catcheth leprosy.’ The Guardian has,
within the last few years, considered the National Assemblies strong
enough to wield the instrument of sanction in the sense of depriving
a Bahá’í of his voting rights. But no one but
himself can pronounce a person to be in that diseased condition we
call ‘Covenant Breaking’ and no one but he can reinstate
a Covenant Breaker. No National Assembly has been given this right
and cannot therefore review the question or reinstate anyone...”

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“...Bahá’u’lláh and the
Master in many places and very emphatically have told us to shun
entirely all Covenant breakers as they are afflicted with what we
might try and define as a contagious spiritual disease; they have
also told us, however, to pray for them. These souls are not lost
forever. In the Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh says
that God will forgive Mírzá Yaḥyá if he
repents. It follows, therefore, that God will forgive any soul if he
repents. Most of them don’t want to repent, unfortunately. If
the leaders can be forgiven it goes without saying that their
followers can also be forgiven...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“As you say, the Writings are not so rich on this
subject and many issues at present baffling the minds of the world
are not even mentioned. The primary consideration is the spirit that
has to permeate our economic life, and this will gradually
crystallize itself into definite institutions and principles that
will help to bring about the ideal condition foretold by
Bahá’u’lláh.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“No, Bahá’u’lláh did not
bring a complete system of economics to the world. Profit sharing is
recommended as a solution to one form of economic problems. There is
nothing in the teachings against some kind of capitalism; its present
form, though, would require adjustments to be made.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“There are practically no technical teachings on
economics in the Cause, such as banking, the price system, and
others. The Cause is not an economic system, nor its Founders be
considered as having been technical economists. The contribution of
the Faith to this subject is essentially indirect, as it consists of
the application of spiritual principles to our present-day economic
system. Bahá’u’lláh has given us a few
basic principles which should guide future Bahá’í
economists in establishing such institutions which will adjust the
economic relationships of the world...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Social inequality is the inevitable outcome of
the natural inequality of man. Human beings are different in ability

and means to put into practice the economic teachings of the Cause,
as explained in some of the recorded Writings and Sayings of
Bahá’u’lláh and the Master. But he believes
that the time is not yet ripe for such activities. First we have to
study the economic teachings in the light of modern problems more
thoroughly so that we may advocate what the Founders of the Faith say
and not what we conjecture from Their Writings. There is great
difference between sounding a great general principle and finding its
application to actual prevailing conditions. Secondly, the Cause is
not financially in a position to launch itself in such undertakings
at present. Such plans need great financial backing to be worked out
in a permanent form. In time, Shoghi Effendi hopes all these things

believers to accept election to an administrative post: The Guardian
strongly feels that criticism, opposition, or confusion do not
provide sufficient grounds for either refusal or resignation. Only
cases of physical or mental incapacity, which, by their very nature,
are extremely rare, constitute valid reasons for such an act. The
difficulties and tests involved in the acceptance of Administrative
posts, far from inducing the believers to dissociate themselves from
the work of the Cause, should spur them on to greater exertions and
to a more active participation in the privileged task of resolving
the problems that confront the Bahá’í community.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Only in cases where individual believers, without
any valid reason, deliberately refuse the repeated exhortations,
pleas, and warnings addressed to them by their Assemblies, should
action be taken in removing them from the voting list. This is a
measure designed to sustain the institutions of the Faith at the
present time, and to insure that the abilities and talents of its, as
yet, limited number of supporters are properly consecrated to its
service.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The believers, for the sake of the Cause, now in
the period of its infancy, should accept their duties in a spirit a
self-sacrifice, and should be animated by the desire to uphold the
verdict of the electorate, and to lend their share of assistance
however difficult the circumstances, to the effective administration
of the affairs of the Faith.</p>

(Radical Changes Not Advised)</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Regarding your questions concerning the
advisability of changing the basis of the National Assembly’s
election and confining it to the body of delegates or of limiting the
term of office: He feels that as any such changes are of a radical
nature and should therefore apply to the National Spiritual
Assemblies of other countries, they are inadvisable and premature,
both for this reason and because of their very nature.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“What is needed is to get the administration in
its present form to run more efficiently and at the same time to
build up a higher sense of the responsibility among the body of the
believers. They should be encouraged to think more, not only about
the qualifications of their elected bodies, but also about such
things as you mention, the law of averages, the age and indisposition
of some of the members, etc.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“When we look back and see what the administration
has accomplished in twenty-odd years, indeed what it has done in the
last seven years, we see what strides forward have been made. Far
greater tasks lie ahead, but the Guardian does not feel that the way
to meet them is to change the present system but rather to perfect it
by educating the believers and training them, holding more
conferences, publishing more news for Bahá’ís,
getting more people active.”</p>

in America.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“To facilitate matters and avoid misunderstandings
he prefers to refer you and the individual friends to them (The
National Assembly). He is sure that you will obtain full satisfaction
by putting the question to them. The purpose of the Guardian in this
is not to avoid the issue but only to facilitate matters and
eliminate misunderstandings. In all such matters the friends should
first approach the Local, then the National Assembly and only in case
they can obtain no satisfaction should they approach the Guardian on
these matters. This way many difficulties will be avoided.”</p>

has been repeatedly encouraged by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
there is no reference either from Him or from Bahá’u’lláh
that can make us believe that it will necessarily develop into the
international auxiliary language of the future. Bahá’u’lláh
has specified in His Writings that such a language will either have
to be chosen from one of the existing languages, or an entirely new
one should be created to serve as a medium of exchange between the
nations and peoples of the world. Pending this final choice, the
Bahá’ís are advised to study Esperanto only in
consideration of the fact that the learning of this language can
considerably facilitate intercommunication between individuals,
groups and Assemblies throughout the Bahá’í world
in the present stage of the evolution of the Faith.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“As regards fasting, it constitutes, together with
the obligatory prayers, the two pillars that sustain the revealed Law
of God. They act as stimulants to the soul, strengthen, revive and
purify it, and thus insure its steady development.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The ordinance of fasting is, as is the case with
these three prayers (obligatory) a spiritual and vital obligation
enjoined by Bahá’u’lláh upon every believer
who has attained the age of fifteen. In the Aqdas He thus writes: ‘We
have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity;
this is ordained by God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.
He has exempted from this those who are weak from illness or age, as
a bounty from His Presence, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous.’
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“And in another passage He says: ‘We have
enjoined upon you fasting during a brief period, and at its close
have designated for you Naw-Rúz as a Feast... The traveller,
the ailing, those who are with child or giving suck, are not bound by
the Fast... Abstain from food and drink, from sunrise to sundown, and
beware lest desire deprive you of this grace that is appointed in the
Book.’</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Also in the ‘Questions and Answers’
that form an appendix to the Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh
reveals the following: ‘Verily, I say that God has appointed a
Great station for fasting and prayer. But during good health its
benefit is evident, and when one is ill, it is not permissible to
fulfill them.’ Concerning the age of maturity, He reveals in
the appendix of that same Book: ‘The age of maturity is in the
fifteenth year; women and men are alike in this respect.’
Regarding the vital character and importance of the Divine ordinances
and laws, and the necessity of complete obedience to them by the
believers, we thus read in the Gleanings, p. 175:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
‘Know verily that the essence of justice and the
source thereof are both embodied in the ordinance prescribed by Him
Who is the Manifestation of the Self of God amongst men, if ye be of
them that recognize this truth. He doth verily incarnate the highest,
the infallible standard of justice unto all creation. Were His law to
be such as to strike terror in the hearts of all that are in heaven
and on earth, that law is naught but manifest justice. The fears and
agitation which the revelation of this law provoke in men’s
hearts should indeed be likened to the cries of the suckling babe
weaned from his mother’s milk, if ye be of them that
perceive...’</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The fasting period, which lasts nineteen days
starting as a rule from the second of March every year and ending on
the twentieth of the same month, involves complete abstention from
food and drink from sunrise till sunset. It is essentially a period
of meditation and prayer, of spiritual recuperation, during which the
believer must strive to make the necessary readjustments in his inner
life, and to refresh and reinvigorate the spiritual forces latent in
his soul. Its significance and purpose are, therefore, fundamentally
spiritual in character. Fasting is symbolic, and a reminder of
abstinence from selfish and carnal desires.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Regarding your question concerning the Fast:
Travellers are exempt from fasting, but if they want to fast while
they are travelling, they are free to do so. You are exempt the whole
period of your travel, not just the hours you are in a train or car,
etc. If one eats unconsciously during the fasting hours, this is not
breaking the Fast as it is an accident. The age limit is 70 years,
but if one desires to fast after the age limit is passed, and is
strong enough to, one is free to do so. If during the Fast period a
person falls ill and is unable to fast, but recovers before the Fast
period is over, he can start to fast again and continue until the
end. Of course the Fast, as you know, can only be kept during the
month set aside for that purpose.”</p>

service: It is extremely simple, as it consists only of a
congregational prayer to be read before burial. This prayer will be
made available to the friends when the Aqdas is translated and
published. In the meantime your N.S.A. should take great care lest
any uniform procedure or ritual in this matter be adopted or imposed

regarding Bahá’í worship, is that a definite
system of rigid rituals and practices be developed among the
believers. The utmost simplicity and flexibility should be observed,
and a selection from the Bahá’í Sacred Writing
should serve the purpose at the present time, provided this selection
is not rigidly and uniformly adopted on all such occasions.”</p>

fact that God guides men through a Mouthpiece, a human being, a
Prophet, infallible and unerring, it is only a logical projection of
this acceptance to also accept the station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and the Guardians. The Guardians are the evidence of the maturity of
mankind in the sense that at long last men have progressed to the
point of having one world, and of needing one world management for
human affairs. In the spiritual realm they have also reached the
point where God could leave, in human hands (i.e. the Guardians)
guided directly by the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh,
as the Master states in His Will, the affairs of His Faith for this
Dispensation. This is what is meant by ‘this is the day which
will not be followed by night.’ In this Dispensation, divine
guidance flows on to us in this world after the Prophet’s
ascension, through first the Master, and then the Guardians. If a

what He has ordained in a Divinely guided individual in matters

Holy Book (the Aqdas) Bahá’u’lláh says to
consult the best physicians, in other words, doctors who have studied
a scientific system of medicine; He never gave us to believe, He
Himself would heal us through ‘Healers’ but rather
through prayer and the assistance of medicine and approved
treatments. Now, as long as your healing is in no opposition to these
principles, as long as you do not try and take the place of a regular
doctor in trying to heal others, but only give them your kind of help
through constructive suggestion--or whatever it may be--and
do not associate this help with being a channel of the direct grace
of Bahá’u’lláh, the Guardian sees no harm

justified in continuing. He will pray for your guidance and

try to apply it in individual relationships, which is abortive,
because the Assembly is a nascent House of Justice and is supposed to
administer, according to the Teachings, the affairs of the Community.
But individuals towards each other are governed by love, unity,
forgiveness and a sin-covering eye. Once the friends grasp this they
will get along much better, but they keep playing Spiritual Assembly
to each other and expect the Assembly to behave like an individual.”

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“As to the meaning of the quotation, ‘My
fears are for Him Who will be sent down unto you after Me,’
this refers to the Manifestation who is to come after a thousand or
more years, who like all previous Messengers of God will be subjected
to persecutions, but will eventually triumph over them. For men of
ill-will have been and will always continue to be in this world,
unless mankind reaches a state of complete and absolute perfection--a
condition which is not only improbable but actually impossible to
attain. The fundamental difference, however, between this
Dispensation and all previous ones is this, that in this Revelation
the possibility of permanent schism between the followers of the
Prophet has been prevented through the direct and explicit
instructions providing for the necessary instruments designed to
maintain the organic unity of the body of the Faithful.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“There is no special physical significance in the
remains of the Prophets or relics of Their Persons. But there is a
profound spiritual significance in the sense that Their dust was the
physical mirror of the greatness of God. In other words we know God
through His Prophets, Who have bodies; these bodies--Their very
dust--are precious through association. It is natural for people
to be touched by a lock of hair or some token of one they loved; how
much more should we treasure and feel moved by a relic of the Beloved
of God?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The Báb has told us to bury the dead in
silk (if possible) in coffins of crystal. Why? Because the body,
though now dust, was once exalted by the immortal soul of man! The
portrait of the Báb should be regarded as an inestimable
privilege and blessing to behold, as past generations were denied a
glimpse of the Face of the Manifestation, once He had passed on.”

them leaves in the place they are laid to rest a spiritual

endowed with a tremendous spiritual influence and far-reaching power.

other people’s, any more than their bodies and physical
functions are different.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“If a Bahá’í marries a
non-Bahá’í who wishes to have the religious
ceremony of his own sect carried out, it must be quite clear that,
first, the Bahá’í partner is understood to be a
Bahá’í by religion, and not to accept the
religion of the other party to the marriage through having his or her
religious ceremony; and second, the ceremony must be of a nature
which does not commit the Bahá’í to any
declaration of faith in a religion other than his own. Under these
circumstances the Bahá’í can partake of the
religious ceremony of his non-Bahá’í partner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The Bahá’í should insist on

the marriage ceremony to confirm without question the fact that the
living natural parents of the two individuals who are being married
have given their consent to the marriage. It is preferable that this
consent be given in writing, but if this is not possible, or
inadvisable for some reason, verbal consent in the present of
witnesses is sufficient.”... “Regarding your question of
applying the sanction of suspension of voting rights to people who
marry without the consent of parents, this should be done from now
on. The laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are explicit and not open to
any ambiguity at all. As long as the parents are alive, the consent
must be obtained; it is not conditioned on their relationship to
their children. If the whereabouts of the parents is not known
legally, in other words, if they are legally dead, then it is not
necessary for the children to obtain their consent, obviously. It is
not a question of the child not knowing the present whereabouts of
the parents, it is a question of a legal thing--if the parents

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“I wish to reaffirm in clear and categorical
language, the principle already enunciated upholding the supreme
authority of the National Assembly in all matters that affect the
interests of the Faith in that land. There can be no conflict of
authority, no duality under any form or circumstances in any sphere
of Bahá’í jurisdiction whether local, national or
international. The National Assembly, however, although the sole
interpreter of its Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, is directly and
morally responsible if it allows any body or institution within its
jurisdiction to abuse its privileges or to decline in the exercise of
its rights and privileges. It is the trusted guardian and the
mainspring of the manifold activities and interests of every national
community in the Bahá’í world. It constitutes the
sole link that binds these communities to the International House of
Justice, the supreme administrative body in the Dispensation of
Bahá’u’lláh.”</p>

the Cause and in which the National Assembly as a body is involved
should, if regarded as unsatisfactory by Local Assemblies and
individual believers, be immediately referred to the National
Assembly itself. Neither the general body of the believers, nor any
Local Assembly, nor even the delegates to the annual Convention,
should be regarded as having any authority to entertain appeals
against the decision of the National Assembly. Should the matter be
referred to the Guardian it will be his duty to consider it with the

consider it in person, or to leave it entirely to the discretion of
the National Assembly.</p>

perfection, is considered by the Bahá’ís as
sacred, because it is symbolic of the perfection of the Bahá’í
Revelation which constitutes the ninth in the line of existing
religions, the latest and fullest Revelation which mankind has ever
known. The eighth is the religion of the Báb and the remaining
seven are: Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity,
Islám, and the religion of the Sabaeans. These religions are
not the only true religions that have appeared in the world but are
the only ones still existing. There have always been Divine Prophets
and Messengers, to many of whom the Qur’án refers. But
the only ones existing are those mentioned above.”</p>

students of religion the question of exactly which are the nine
existing religions is controversial, and it would be better to avoid
it. He does not want the friends to be rigid in these matters, but
use their judgment and tact, sometimes one statement is exactly the
right thing for one type of mind and the wrong thing for another.</p>

View of)</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“With reference to the absolute pacifists, or
conscientious objectors to war; their attitude, judged from the
Bahá’í standpoint is quite anti-social and due to
its exaltation of the individual conscience leads inevitably to
disorder and chaos in society. Extreme pacifists are thus very close
to the anarchists, in the sense that both of these groups lay an
undue emphasis on the rights and merits of the individual. The Bahá’í
conception of social life is essentially based on the subordination
of the individual will to that of society. It neither suppresses the
individual nor does it exalt him to the point of making him an
anti-social creature, a menace to society. As in everything, it
follows the ‘golden mean’. The only way that society can
function is for the minority to follow the will of the majority.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The other main objection to the conscientious
objectors is that their method of establishing peace is too negative.
Non-cooperation is too passive a philosophy to become an effective
way for social reconstruction. Their refusal to bear arms can never
establish peace. There should first be a spiritual revitalization
which nothing, except the Cause of God, can effectively bring to
every man’s heart.”</p>

The shortest one consists of a single verse which has to be recited
once in every twenty-four hours and at midday. The medium (prayer)
which begins with the words: ‘The Lord is witness that there is
none other God but He,’ has to be recited three times a day, in
the morning, at noon and in the evening. The long prayer which is the
most elaborate of the three has to be recited once in every
twenty-four hours, and at any time one feels inclined to do so.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The believer is entirely free to choose any one
of those three prayers but is under the obligation of reciting one of
them, and in accordance with any specific directions with which they
may be accompanied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“These daily obligatory prayers, together with a
few other specific ones, such as the Healing Prayer, the Tablet of
Ahmad, have been invested by Bahá’u’lláh
with a special potency and significance, and should therefore be
accepted as such and be recited by the believers with unquestioned
faith and confidence, that through them they may enter into a much

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Regarding the solution of the racial problem; the
believers should of course realize that the principle of the oneness
of mankind which is the cornerstone of the message of Bahá’u’lláh
is wholly incompatible with all forms of racial prejudice. Loyalty to
this foundation principle of the Faith is the paramount duty of every
believer and should be therefore wholehearted and unqualified. For a
Bahá’í, racial prejudice, in all its forms, is
simply a negation of Faith, an attitude wholly incompatible with the
very spirit and actual teachings of the Cause.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“But while the friends should faithfully and
courageously uphold this Bahá’í principle of the
essential unity of all human races, yet in the methods they adopt for
its application and further realization on the social plane they
should act with tact, wisdom and moderation. These two attitudes are
by no means exclusive. Bahá’ís do not believe
that the spread of the Cause and its principles and teachings can be
effected by means of radical and violent methods. While they are
loyal to all those teachings, yet they believe in the necessity of
resorting to peaceful and friendly means for the realization of their
aims.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“As regards the meaning of the passage on page 188

Although they may abrogate the laws of this Dispensation in
accordance with the needs and requirements of the age in which they
appear, they nevertheless draw their spiritual force from this mighty
Revelation. The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
constitutes, indeed, the stage of maturity in the development of
mankind. His appearance has released such spiritual forces which will
continue to animate, for many long years to come, the world in its
development. Whatever progress may be achieved, in later ages, after
the unification of the whole human race is achieved, will be but
improvement in the machinery of the world. For the machinery itself
has been already created by Bahá’u’lláh.
The task of continually improving and perfecting this machinery is
one which later Prophets will be called upon to achieve. They will
thus move and work within the orbit of the Bahá’í

for every believer who wishes to adequately understand and
intelligently read, the writings of Bahá’u’lláh.
Although there are very few persons among Western Bahá’ís
who are capable of handling such a course in a scholarly way, the
mere lack of such competent teachers should encourage and stimulate
the believers to get better acquainted with the Sacred Scriptures of

requires a detailed knowledge of the social, religious and historical

The believers can not possibly hope, therefore, to understand the
Súrihs after the first or even second or third reading. They
have to study them again and again, ponder over their meaning, with
the help of certain commentaries and explanatory notes as found, for
instance, in the admirable translation made by SALE, endeavor to
acquire as clear and correct understanding of their meaning and
import as possible. This is naturally a slow process, but future
generations of believers will certainly come to grasp it. For the
present, the Guardian agrees, that it would be easier and more
helpful to study the Book according to subjects, and note verse by

throw such floods of light on the whole of the Qur’án.”

NON-BAHÁ’Í</span></h1>

religious associations, the Guardian wishes to re-emphasize the
general principle already laid down in his communications to your
Assembly and also to the individual believers that no Bahá’í
who wishes to be a whole hearted and sincere upholder of the
distinguishing principles of the Cause can accept full membership in
any non-Bahá’í ecclesiastical organization. For
such an act would necessarily imply only a partial acceptance of the
Teachings and Laws of the Faith, and an incomplete recognition of its
independent status, and would thus be tantamount to an act of
disloyalty to the verities it enshrines. For it is only too obvious
that in most of its fundamental assumptions the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh
is completely at variance with outworn creeds, ceremonies, and
institutions. To be a Bahá’í and at the same time
accept membership in another religious body is simply an act of
contradiction that no sincere and logically-minded person can
possibly accept. To follow Bahá’u’lláh does
not mean accepting some of His teachings and rejecting the rest.
Allegiance to His Cause must be uncompromising and whole-hearted.
During the days of the Master the Cause was still in a stage that
made such an open and sharp disassociation between it and other
religious organizations, and particularly the Muslim Faith not only
inadvisable but practically impossible to establish. But since His
passing, events throughout the Bahá’í World and
particularly in Egypt where the Muslim religious courts have formally
testified to the independent character of the Faith, have developed
to a point that have made such an assertion of the independence of
the Cause not only highly desirable but absolutely essential.”</p>

this passage seeks to refute the argument of the Muslims, who attach
a purely literal interpretation to this verse of the Qur’án,
and therefore consider it as implying bodily resurrection. To these
Muslims, He says, that you who literally believe that the human body
will return to dust and will be raised from it again, and therefore
attach so much importance to this mortal world, how then can you wax

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Concerning the idea of the Bahá’í
World Order and the proper emphasis which should be laid on the
social aspect of the Faith; the Guardian feels the necessity for all
teachers to stress the fact that the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh
can, under no circumstances, be divorced from the spiritual
principles and teachings of the Cause; that the social laws and
institutions of the Faith are inseparably bound up and closely
interwoven with the moral and spiritual principles enunciated by
Bahá’u’lláh, Who, Himself, indeed, has time
and again emphasized the underlying oneness and the identity of
purpose of all His spiritual, doctrinal, and social teachings. The
Friends, while emphasizing both of these aspects, should, in
particular, point out that they constitute parts of one and the same
plan, and elements of a single, divine and world-embracing system.”

are by no means easy to overcome, specially in view of the limited
number and resources of the believers. But in the field of Bahá’í
service, as the history of the Cause abundantly demonstrates, there
is no obstacle that can be said to be unsurmountable. Every
difficulty will, in due time, be solved. But continued and collective
effort is also needed. The Bahá’í teacher should
not get discouraged at the consciousness of the limitations within or
without him. He should rather persevere, and be confident, that no
matter how numerous and perplexing the difficulties that confront him
may appear, he is continually assisted and guided through Divine
Confirmations. He should consider himself as a mere instrument in the
Hands of God, and should, therefore, cease looking at his own merits.

(Can Serve as Both)</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Regarding the statement made by the Guardian ...
concerning the fact that believers can serve both as teachers and
administrators. Shoghi Effendi would approve your Assembly making
this fact known to all the friends. For although it is essential for
the believers to maintain always a clear distinction between teaching
and administrative duties and functions, yet they should be careful
not to be led to think that these two types of Bahá’í
activity are mutually exclusive in their nature and as such cannot be
exercised by one and the same person. As a matter of fact, the
friends should be encouraged to serve in both the teaching and the
administrative fields of Bahá’í service. But as
there are always some who are more specially gifted along one of
these two lines of activity it would seem more desirable that they
should concentrate their efforts in acquiring the full training for
that type of work for which they are best suited by nature. Such a
specialization has the advantage of saving time and of leading to
greater efficiency, particularly at this early stage of our
development. The great danger, however, lies in that by so doing the
friends may tend to develop a sort of class consciousness which is
fundamentally contrary to both the spirit and actual teachings of the
Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“It is precisely in order to overcome such a

personality, the Guardian wishes to make it clear that it was never
intended that well qualified individual teachers should not receive
from local Assemblies every encouragement and facilities to address
the public. What the Guardian meant was that the personality and
popularity of such a speaker should never be allowed to eclipse the
authority or detract from the influence of the body of the elected
representatives in every local community. Such an individual should
not only seek the approval, advice and assistance of the body that
represents the Cause in his locality, but should strive to attribute
any credit he may obtain, to the collective wisdom and capacity of
the Assembly under whose jurisdiction he performs his services.
Assemblies and not individuals constitute the bedrock on which the
Administration is built. Everything else must be subordinated to, and
be made to serve and advance the best interests of these elected
custodians and promoters of the laws of Bahá’u’lláh.”

the efforts of the friends on the home front when they meditate on

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Regarding the whole manner of teaching the Faith
in the South; the Guardian feels that, although the greatest
consideration should be shown the feelings of white people in the
South whom we are teaching, under no circumstances should we
discriminate in their favour, consider them more valuable to the
Cause than their Negro fellow-southerners, or single them out to be
taught the Message first. To pursue such a policy, however necessary
and even desirable it may superficially seem, would be to compromise
the true spirit of our Faith, which permits us to make no such
distinctions in offering its tenets to the world. The Negro and white
races should be offered, simultaneously, on a basis of equality, the
Message of Bahá’u’lláh. Rich or poor, known
or unknown, should be permitted to hear of this Holy Faith in this,
humanity’s greatest hour of need.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“This does not mean that we should go against the
laws of the State, pursue a radical course which will stir up
trouble, and cause misunderstanding... Even in places where the two
races can meet together in the South, he feels it would be, in
certain cases, preferable to teach them separately until they are
fully confirmed and then bring them together...”</p>

system, for teachers to practice, exists. But obviously the more
people know about the teachings and the Cause, the better they will
be to present the subject. If some people find that prayer and
placing all their trust in God, releases in them a flood of
inspiration, they should be left free to pursue this method if it is
productive of results.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The inspiration received through meditation is of
a nature that one cannot measure or determine. God can inspire into
our minds things that we had no previous knowledge of, if He desires
to do so.</p>

Shoghi Effendi wishes in this connection to urge the friends to avoid
all forms of rigidity and uniformity in matters of worship. There is
no objection to the recital or chanting of prayers in the Oriental
language, but there is also no obligation whatsoever of adopting such
a form of prayer at any devotional service in the auditorium of the
Temple. It should neither be required nor prohibited. The important
thing that should always be borne in mind is that with the exception
of certain specific obligatory prayers, Bahá’u’lláh
has given us no strict or special rulings in matters of worship,
whether in the Temple or elsewhere. Prayer is essentially a communion
between man and God, and as such transcends all ritualistic forms and
formulae.”</p>

those individuals whom the Local Assembly or the N.S.A. have
considered it necessary to deprive of the voting right and to suspend
from local meetings and gatherings; such action which Local and
National Assemblies have been empowered to take against such
recalcitrant members, however justified and no matter how severe,
should under no circumstances be considered as implying the complete
expulsion of the individuals affected from the Cause. The suspension
of voting and other administrative rights of an individual, always
conditional and therefore temporary, can never have such far reaching
implications, since it constitutes merely an administrative sanction;
whereas his expulsion or ex-communication from the Faith, which can
be effected by the Guardian alone in his capacity as the supreme
spiritual head of the community, has far-reaching spiritual
implications affecting the very soul of that believer. The former, as
already stated, is an administrative sanction, whereas the latter is
essentially spiritual, involving not only the particular relationship
of a believer to his local or National Assembly, but his very
spiritual existence in the Cause. It follows, therefore, that a
believer can continue calling himself a Bahá’í
even though he may cease to be a voting member of the community. But
in case he is excluded from the body of the Cause by an act of the
Guardian he ceases to be a believer and cannot possibly identify
himself even nominally with the Faith.”</p>

command concerning the engagement of the believers in some sort of
profession; the teachings are most emphatic on this matter,
particularly the statement in the Aqdas to this effect which makes it
quite clear that idle people who lack the desire to work can have no
place in the new World Order. As a corollary of this principle,
Bahá’u’lláh further states that mendicity
should not only be discouraged but entirely wiped out from the face
of society. It is the duty of those who are in charge of the
organization of society to give every individual the opportunity of
acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of profession, and also
the means of utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and for
the sake of earning the means of his livelihood. Every individual, no
matter how handicapped and limited he may be, is under the obligation
of engaging in some work or profession, for work, especially when
performed in the spirit of service, is according to Bahá’u’lláh,
a form of worship. It has not only a utilitarian purpose, but has a
value in itself, because it draws us nearer to God, and enables to
better grasp His purpose for us in this world. It is obvious,
therefore, that the inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune
from daily work. As to the question of retirement from work for
individuals who have reached a certain age, this is a matter on which
the International House of Justice will have to legislate as there
are no provisions in the Aqdas concerning it.”</p>

modern youth are becoming increasingly grave, and call for immediate
solution. But, as experience clearly shows, the remedy to this truly
sad and perplexing situation is not to be found in traditional and
ecclesiastical religion. The dogmatism of the Church has been
discarded once for all. What can control youth and save it from the
pitfalls of the crass materialism of the age is the power of a
genuine, constructive and living Faith such as the one revealed to
the world by Bahá’u’lláh. Religion as in
the past, is still the world’s sole hope, but not that form of
religion which our ecclesiastical leaders strive vainly to preach.
Divorced from true religion, morals lose their effectiveness and
cease to guide and control man’s individual and social life.
But when true religion is combined with true ethics, then moral
progress becomes a possibility and not a mere ideal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The need of our modern youth is for such a type
of ethics founded on pure religious faith. Not until these two are

they must prepare themselves for the great tasks that lie ahead. This
particularly applies to Bahá’í youth. Young men

being permitted to serve on committees other than the Youth Committee
has been raised in a number of letters recently, and in considering

Though they cannot be voting members of Bahá’í
communities (or exercise the electoral vote at all until they reach
that age), and though they cannot, likewise, be elected to
Assemblies, there is no reason why they should not serve the Cause on
various committees as all committees, national or local, are

YOUTH IN SCHOOL</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The problem with which you are faced is one which
concerns and seriously puzzles many of our present-day youth. How to
attain spirituality is indeed a question to which every young man and
woman must sooner or later try to find a satisfactory answer. It is
precisely because no such satisfactory answer has been given or
found, that the modern youth finds itself bewildered, and is being
consequently carried away by the materialistic forces that are so
powerfully undermining the foundations of man’s moral and
spiritual life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Indeed the chief reason for the evils now rampant
in society is the lack of spirituality. The materialistic
civilization of our age has so much absorbed the energy and interest
of mankind that people in general do no longer feel the necessity of
raising themselves above the forces and conditions of their daily
material existence. There is not sufficient demand for things that we
call spiritual to differentiate them from the needs and requirements
of our physical existence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“The universal crisis affecting mankind is,
therefore, essentially spiritual in its causes. The spirit of the
age, taken on the whole, is irreligious. Man’s outlook on life
is too crude and materialistic to enable him to elevate himself into
the higher realms of the spirit.</p>

society has fallen, that religion seeks to improve and transform. For
the core of religious faith is that mystic feeling which unites Man
with God. This state of spiritual communion can be brought about and
maintained by means of meditation and prayer. And this is the reason
why Bahá’u’lláh has so much stressed the
importance of worship. It is not sufficient for a believer merely to
accept and observe the teachings. He should, in addition, cultivate
the sense of spirituality which he can acquire chiefly by means of
prayer. The Bahá’í Faith, like all other Divine
Religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character. Its chief goal
is the development of the individual and society, through the
acquisition of spiritual virtues and powers. It is the soul of man
which has first to be fed. And this spiritual nourishment prayer can
best provide.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">“Laws and institutions, as viewed by Bahá’u’lláh,
can become really effective only when our inner spiritual life has
been perfected and transformed. Otherwise religion will degenerate
into a mere organization, and becomes a dead thing. The believers,
particularly the young ones, should therefore fully realize the
necessity of praying. For prayer is absolutely indispensable to their
inner spiritual development, and this, as already stated, is the very
foundation and purpose of the religion of God.”</p>
